# Scheme langauge interpreter

An interactive shell with an interpreter of "reduced" version of [Scheme](https://scheme.com/tspl4/) programming language. It supports:

* Basic computing
* Logical functions
* Lambdas
* If-else statements
* Defining variables and changing their values
* Context capturing

You can build the following program using CMake (13.9 and higher).

(btw I also implemented the parser and the tokenizer for building an AST-tree)

### TODO:
